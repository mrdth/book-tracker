- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items passed successfully
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- The feature has a clear scope: adding a Delete button to the author page that removes the author and all associated books
- Cascading deletion behavior is defined at the entity relationship level (not implementation)
- All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases cover scenarios like concurrent operations, large datasets, and error conditions

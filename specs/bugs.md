Issues:
- when importing an author & books, we need pagination for authors with many books.


feature suggestions:
- On author page be able to filter which books are shown:
  - all
  - owned
  - not owned
- fuzzy matching of local book titles during owned check
- replace console.error messages with an error banner / toast
- prepare for deploy - can we re-use existing code from mrdth/docker-dashboard?
